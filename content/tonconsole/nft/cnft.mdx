# Compressed NFTs (cNFTs)

Compressed NFTs (cNFTs) are a format that allows for the creation of massive collections (up to one billion NFTs) without significant time and $TON costs typically associated with minting. The cNFT format combines two types of storage:

- **On-chain:** Data is stored directly on the blockchain, making it visible and accessible to all network participants.
- **Off-chain:** Data is stored on a secure server (e.g., Amazon), which enables faster and more efficient operations with NFTs since they do not require direct blockchain processing.

Minting (registering on the blockchain) of a cNFT occurs upon the first interaction with the digital item. At this moment, the cNFT becomes indistinguishable from a regular NFT, as the digital item is added to the blockchain, making it visible and exchangeable. The cost of registering a cNFT on the blockchain is equivalent to the cost of minting a regular NFT, which is a small symbolic fee.

For technical implementation details on how to create and manage cNFTs, please refer to:

## cNFT Indexing Service

The cNFT Indexing Service allows you to add and index your cNFTs via the <ExternalLink href={CONSOLE_LINKS.CNFT}>Tonconsole</ExternalLink> interface, making them available through TonAPI without requiring immediate on-chain minting.

- **Tonconsole Interface:** Enables the addition and indexing of cNFTs, making them searchable and accessible across all applications that use TonAPI, including Tonviewer and Tonkeeper, without needing to mint them on-chain until the first interaction.

For more information on how to index your cNFTs using Tonconsole, please refer to the relevant documentation and console usage guides.

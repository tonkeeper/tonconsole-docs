# Webhooks API

Webhooks API provides a way to subscribe to events that happen in the TON blockchain.
This allows you to build applications that react to events in the blockchain.


# Authentication
All methods of Webhooks API require a private API key.
You can get a personal API key at https://tonconsole.com/.

Webhooks API looks for an API key in two places in the following order:
1. In the Authorization header with the "Bearer scheme".
For example:
```
Bearer eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
```
2. In the "token" parameter of the query string.
For example:
```
https://rt.tonapi.io/webhooks?token=eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
```

# API methods to manage webhooks

When a transaction happens on an account, TONAPI sends a POST request to a webhook URL.
The request body contains the account's ID, the transaction's hash and LT.
An example of a request body:
```json
{
  "account_id":"0:8f2d840ec05d118f98459a057b1fcab535c57b9371222be15667fee932ceaf53",
  "lt":49739623000001,
  "tx_hash":"653e593d581ad40d5d0868fe5d60008e1bfe9d2d4c4fa6b2ee5cd458741d7b59"
}
```


## Create webhook

POST https://rt.tonapi.io/webhooks - the method creates a new webhook, configures its endpoint and returns a webhook ID.
A webhook ID is used to manage subscriptions to account transactions.

A request body:
```json
{
  "endpoint": "https://your-server.com/webhook"
}
```
A response example:
```json
{
  "webhook_id": 5
}
```

## List webhooks

GET https://rt.tonapi.io/webhooks - the method returns all available webhooks: their IDs and endpoints.
A response example:
```json
{
  "webhooks": [
    { "id": 5, "endpoint": "https://your-server.com/webhook" },
    { "id": 6, "endpoint": "https://your-server.com/another-webhook" }
  ]
}
```

## Delete a webhook
DELETE https://rt.tonapi.io/webhooks/{webhook_id} - the method deletes a webhook and all its subscriptions.

## Subscribe to account transactions

POST https://rt.tonapi.io/webhooks/{webhook_id}/account-tx/subscribe - the method takes in a list of account IDs to subscribe to. When a new transaction happens on any of the accounts,
TONAPI sends a POST request to the webhook URL.

A request body:
```json
  {"accounts": [{"account_id": "0:6ccd325a858c379693fae2bcaab1c2906831a4e10a6c3bb44ee8b615bca1d220"}]}
```

## Unsubscribe from account transactions
POST https://rt.tonapi.io/webhooks/{webhook_id}/account-tx/unsubscribe - the method takes in a list of account IDs to unsubscribe from.

A request body:
```json
  {"accounts": ["0:6ccd325a858c379693fae2bcaab1c2906831a4e10a6c3bb44ee8b615bca1d220"]}
```

## Get a webhook's subscriptions
GET https://rt.tonapi.io/webhooks/{webhook_id}/account-tx/subscriptions?offset=0&limit=10

A response example:
```json
{
  "account_tx_subscriptions": [
    {
        "account_id": "0:6ccd325a858c379693fae2bcaab1c2906831a4e10a6c3bb44ee8b615bca1d220",
        "last_delivered_lt": 2900000001,
        "failed_at": "<time of failure>",
        "failed_lt": 2900000000,
        "failed_attempts": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

## Subscribe to events about new contract deployments

POST https://rt.tonapi.io/webhooks/{webhook_id}/subscribe-new-contracts - when a new contract is deployed to the blockchain,

## Unsubscribe from events about new contract deployments

POST https://rt.tonapi.io/webhooks/{webhook_id}/unsubscribe-new-contracts - stop receiving a webhook notification when a new contract is deployed to the blockchain.

## Subscribe to messages with a specific opcode in a message body

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This subscription will trigger webhooks for **every** message on the blockchain that contains the specified opcode — even if it's unrelated to your accounts.
</Callout>

POST https://rt.tonapi.io/webhooks/{webhook_id}/subscribe-msg-opcode/0x{opcode} - when a new transaction is happening with a message that contains a specific opcode in its body,
TONAPI sends a POST request to the webhook URL.

## Unsubscribe from messages with a specific opcode in a message body

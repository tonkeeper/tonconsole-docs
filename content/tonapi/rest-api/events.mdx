# Events

**Events** service provides access to high-level actions that occur on the TON blockchain. These actions are derived from traces, which represent a series of transactions caused by a single inbound message. Events are meaningful operations such as Jetton transfers, NFT purchases, and other user interactions. By using the **Events** service, you can retrieve detailed information about user activities on the TON blockchain.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Can't be used for building logic, as the structure of events can change at any
  time.
</Callout>

Use it only for displaying information to users.

The **Blockchain** service provides low-level access to the TON blockchain, enabling retrieval of detailed information about blocks, transactions, accounts, and more. These endpoints are essential for building tools that require deep blockchain data and are critical for applications that interact closely with the TON blockchain.

**TONAPI** ensures that data retrieved from the blockchain is accurate and up-to-date by continuously indexing the blockchain and maintaining a low-latency connection to the TON network.

If You do not agree to any such update, You should stop using the API and API Data before the update takes effect.

## Our API and How We Work with Developers

Our application programming interface (API) can be accessed at https://tonconsole.com/ and includes any documents (electronic or otherwise) that come with the API. Our API is intended to be used as an interface between: 
1. Our platform built on a blockchain system, which allows users to store their private keys, interact with our blockchain, and conduct cryptocurrency transactions, streaming services, and other features, content, or applications offered or operated by Us (Platform).
2. Applications or services provided by You through Your software and cloud services (Application).

By using our API, you may access or otherwise use on Our Platform certain content, images, photographs, illustrations, icons, texts, video, audio, written materials, software, or other data (API Data).

## Scope of these API Terms of Use

The main things that We care about are that each of Our Platform, the rights of Our end users, and Our API are protected.

These API Terms of Use set out Our and Your respective rights and obligations relating to the use of Our APIs to interface between Our Platform and Your Application and use of the API Data.

Your use of any of Our other products or services on Our Platform will be on different terms and conditions. If these API Terms of Use and the terms applicable to Our other products or services are inconsistent as to the terms applicable to the use of Our API, the terms applicable to Our other products or services shall apply.

If these API Terms of Use do not specifically say that You can do something in connection with the API, the API Data, or the Platform, then You cannot.

## Access to the API

You agree:
- To access the API only using the API key that We give You.
- To keep Your API key secure and that You are responsible for any use of the API using Your key.

  - Any terms applicable to the Platform.
  - Any other terms agreed between Us and You.
  - All relevant legislation, regulations, codes of practice, guidance, and other requirements of any relevant jurisdiction, government or regulatory agency, or other regulatory body.

### What the API Must Not Be Used For

You must not use the API to:
- Send spam or interfere with or degrade Our services.

## Confidentiality

You shall keep Our confidential information confidential.

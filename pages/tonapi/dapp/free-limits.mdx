# Using free high TONAPI limits in your dApp with Tonkeeper

## Overview
TONAPI is already available for free, but with a default rate limit of **1 request per second (1 RPS)**. If your dApp requires higher limits, you can take advantage of Tonkeeper's built-in mechanism to gain additional API capacity at no extra cost.

[Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/) introduces a way for dApps to access high TONAPI limits for free. This feature allows dApps running in the **Tonkeeper browser** or in **any browser with the Tonkeeper extension installed** to leverage a built-in proxy mechanism that optimizes API requests.

## How It Works
When a dApp is opened inside the Tonkeeper browser or a browser with the Tonkeeper extension, the global `window.tonapi` object becomes available. If the dApp is using [@ton-api/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton-api/client), it will automatically leverage this object. `window.tonapi` provides a custom `fetch` implementation that routes requests through Tonkeeper's internal proxy, sending them on behalf of Tonkeeper's TONAPI provider.

### Key Benefits
- **Higher rate limits:** Requests made via `window.tonapi.fetch` are processed with higher TONAPI limits.
- **No extra setup:** The dApp does not need to modify API callsâ€”just use `@ton-api/client` as usual.
- **Works in the Tonkeeper browser and in any browser with the Tonkeeper extension installed.**

## Integration Guide
### 1. Ensuring Proper API Key Usage
Even when using `window.tonapi.fetch`, you **must provide a valid TONAPI key** when initializing `@ton-api/client`. The key can be a free-tier key, but it must be valid.

```ts
import { TonApiClient } from "@ton-api/client";

const tonApi = new TonApiClient({
    apiKey: "your-valid-tonapi-key"
});
```

If `window.tonapi` is available, `@ton-api/client` will automatically use `window.tonapi.fetch` for making requests.

### 2. Restricting Your dApp to free high limit
If you want to ensure that your dApp only functions in environments where `window.tonapi` is available , you can enforce this restriction:

```ts
if (!window.tonapi) {
    alert("This dApp requires Tonkeeper to function properly.");
    throw new Error("window.tonapi is required");
}
```

## Summary
- `window.tonapi.fetch` allows dApps running in the Tonkeeper browser or a browser with the Tonkeeper extension to use high TONAPI limits.
- You must provide a valid TONAPI key when initializing `@ton-api/client`.
- You can restrict your dApp to work only when `window.tonapi` is available if you need high RPS.

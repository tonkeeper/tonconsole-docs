# Emulation<SwaggerLink tag={SWAGGER_TAGS.EMULATION} />

The Emulation methods provide tools for predicting the outcomes of blockchain transactions before they are executed. These tools allow for simulating transactions, offering insights into their results, including an almost precise estimate of network fees (with a small margin of error due to limitations in fully emulating a contract’s internal state).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The fee estimate may be slightly lower than the actual amount, approximately up to 0.05 TON.
</Callout>

### Possible use cases
- Predicting transaction outcomes to verify correctness before execution.
- Estimating network fees for accurate cost calculation.
- Enabling services to display transaction results to end users in advance.


### Implementation Example  

A detailed example of gasless transaction implementation is available in the [Cookbook](/tonapi/cookbook#emmulation).

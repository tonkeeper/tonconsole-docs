# Jetton Airdrop Technical and Commercial Terms (T&C Terms)

These T&C Terms shall be read in conjunction with the [Airdrop Terms of Use](./terms.md)

Service enables a mass token distribution model where the recipient (**Recipient**) pays a fixed fee in TONs and receives jettons (**Jettons**).
The distribution is carried out to a fixed list of Recipients. In the following, we will refer to the Jetton distribution process as an **Airdrop**.

## How it works
1. The Airdrop organizer (**Airdrop admin**) prepares a file with a fixed list of Recipients (**Airdrop file**)
2. The Airdrop admin creates a new project in Ton Console and fills in the Airdrop data
3. The Airdrop admin connects their wallet via TON Connect (in Ton Console) and deploys the Airdrop smart contracts
4. The Airdrop admin on their hosting raises a dApp that allows the Recipient to connect their wallet and receive Jettons by paying a fee

## Airdrop file preparation

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸš¨">
    Only the account specified in the **Airdrop file** can claim Jettons.
    The Airdrop file must include addresses of the wallets in the TON blockchain supported by the Ton Connect protocol.
</Callout>

### File format requirements
1. CSV format with a comma delimiter
2. Contain a header in the format: `recipient,amount`
3. Jetton amount in minimal indivisible units (example: `1000000` for 1 USDT where decimals=6). Decimals can be found in the Jetton [metadata](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/nft-processing/metadata-parsing#jetton-metadata-attributes). The value must be positive, and decimal points are not allowed.
4. Recipient's wallet addresses in user-friendly or raw format ([Address formats](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses#raw-and-user-friendly-addresses)) with no duplicates
5. File size up to 10,000,000 records

### Airdrop file example
```csv
recipient,amount
0:d0ef5351eb05503c10a447543113b315e772d147c51aaa81aa308b5cae99e07e,2567953998
0:199b41bcda2472b057d72f80e2e8ba5e15dcb776e68c9eeea393dad668248068,3127429615
0:aa1e7af003374652e13f705b8c7010b3cf8708f5f98f43c999b8ec4e2c0e0cdf,562536354
```

### Airdrop file hash verification
After downloading the Airdrop file, verify the sha256 hash of your original file and the hash in the Ton Console.

## Airdrop admin

When creating a new Airdrop in Ton Console, you will need to connect your wallet via Ton Connect.
The address of this wallet will be recorded as the Airdrop admin`s address for the contracts.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸš¨">
    Only Airdrop admin will be able to manage the distribution (such as completing the distribution and withdrawing the accumulated profit).
    To send messages in batches, a wallet capable of sending 255 messages is required. Ton Console requires connecting a W5 wallet only.
</Callout>

## Jetton for distribution

To create an Airdrop you will need to specify the address of the Jetton master contract ([Jetton Architecture](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/jettons#jetton-architecture)) in a user-friendly or raw format.
For example: Notcoin address is `EQAvlWFDxGF2lXm67y4yzC17wYKD9A0guwPkMs1gOsM__NOT` ([Tonviewer](https://tonviewer.com/EQAvlWFDxGF2lXm67y4yzC17wYKD9A0guwPkMs1gOsM__NOT)).

If you have created a Jetton not based on the standard smart contract or are sending a Jetton minted by someone else, be cautious.
Custom smart contract logic may disrupt the distribution process (e.g. the transfer fees may be significantly higher). Use only trusted Jettons.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸš¨">
  Before starting distributions of new Jettons, be sure to conduct a test run with a small number of Recipients.
</Callout>

## Claim Fee

This is a key Airdrop setting. It determines how much the Recipient will pay for the request of Jettons via a claim message (**Claim**) in addition to any other fees paid by the Recipient.

When a Recipient signs a Claim message via Ton Connect, they pay a `Claim fee` (**Claim fee**) in TON for the distribution contract to accept the message.
In addition to the Claim fee, the Recipient also pays a blockchain fee for sending this message.

Example:
```
claim_fee = 0.15 TON
blockchain_fee(forward_fee + gas_fee + ...) = ~0.0076 TON
recipient_pays = claim_fee + blockchain_fee = 0.15 + ~0.0076 = ~0,1576 TON
```

## Fee Sharing

The Claim fee is used to cover blockchain fees incurred during the claim process, and the remainder is sent to special distribution smart contracts.

Example of a Claim operation in the testnet: [Tonviewer](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/7076abbeb1a4e614965ed5f97b8e400bb2227aca54a72b60f2e373d2d0a92207).

In the given example, the distributor contract will receive `excess` (**Excess**) = 0.1147384 TON.
`distributor_balance_change` is equal to +0.112809142 TON and is slightly less than the Excess due to blockchain fees for the payment of which the Airdrop admin is responsible.
The estimate amount could be seen in the `Value flow` tab of the given Claim operation example.

The amount of TONs received by the distributor contract is divided in the following proportion:

`royalty_receiver_share = royalty_coefficient * excess`

`admin_share = excess - royalty_receiver_share - blockchain_fee`, 

where the royalty receiver share is the fees of Scalable Data Solutions Inc and admin share is the fees of the Airdrop admin.

The blockchain fees shall be paid are charged both at the time of receiving Excess and upon executing any subsequent transactions involving distribution contracts.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸš¨">
  Keep in mind that blockchain fees may vary depending on the Jettons contracts and other factors (e.g. the presence of a deployed Jetton wallet for the Recipient).
  Therefore, the provided proportions of the Excess division is approximate. For more accurate estimates, you can conduct test Airdrop.
</Callout>

## dApp for Recipients to claim Jettons

Airdrop admin should deploy a dApp on their side (website, landing page) where the Recipient can connect their wallet via Ton Connect and sign a Claim.

### Reference application

You can find the reference application [here](https://tonkeeper.github.io/airdrop-reference-dapp/).
You can find the source code here: [GitHub](https://github.com/tonkeeper/airdrop-reference-dapp).

To configure the reference application, use the following URL format:
```
https://tonkeeper.github.io/airdrop-reference-dapp/?airdropId=<ID>
```

- Replace `<ID>` with the Airdrop ID from Ton Console.

### API for dApp interaction

Our backend has a method for interacting with the Claim dApp. Through it, the dApp receives the necessary data for the Recipient.

When you click the `Enable claim` button in the Ton Console dashboard, you grant the Recipients access to this method; when you click `Disable claim`, you close it.

`GET {host}/v1/airdrop/claim/{address}?id={airdrop_id}`

Returns (or error):
```json
{
  "claim_message": {
    "mode": 3,
    "address": "EQBdywJayJlH1PQDDNr1cX8_wOIFzxLpptbA3m5VxXPGR7wz",
    "state_init": "base64string",
    "payload": "base64string",
    "amount": "150000000"
  },
  "jetton_amount": "58701809",
  "jetton": "EQAZG3WSEZCd0qj-4QtCcGtMKDH9OoGD4godKRe65ceQj6Hf"
}
```

Where request parameters:
1. `host` - address of Claim API: `https://mainnet-airdrop.tonapi.io`
2. `address` - Recipient address in raw form. Example: `0:585eacf04d4df6c8a2e4f1ed1008e1ac3e36e14cbc37cddaf1f329a50ad43853`
3. `airdrop_id` - unique Airdrop ID from the Airdrop dashboard in Ton Console. Example: `fa541433-ceef-4286-a76c-1be7c6198632`

The dApp should retrieve the `address` from the wallet connected through Ton Connect.

Where response parameters:

`claim_message` - contains the data necessary for forming a message via Ton Connect
1. `mode` - message sending mode (Ton Connect always sends with mode 3)
2. `address` - destination address of the message in user-friendly format containing the bounce flag
3. `state_init` - serialized state init cell in base64 format
4. `payload` - serialized body cell in base64 format
5. `amount` - amount of TONs attached to the message (`Claim Fee`)

`jetton_amount` - Jetton amount in minimal indivisible units (from the Airdrop file)
`jetton` - address of the Jetton master contract

### Response error codes

#### Error format
```json
{
  "code": 2,
  "message": "locked"
}
```

#### 423 (Locked)
* `{"code":1, "message":"not processed yet"}` - the Airdrop data has not yet been processed. Wait for processing. The error CANNOT appear if the workflow in the Ton Console is followed.
* `{"code":2, "message":"locked"}` - the error occurs if the Claim is set to `Disabled` in the Ton Console.
* `{"code":3, "message":"already claimed"}` - the Recipient has already claimed previously.
* `{"code":4, "message":"blockchain overload"}` - the blockchain is overloaded. Claim temporarily suspended. Try claiming later.

#### 400 (Bad request)
* "invalid id: <err>" - an incorrect Airdrop ID was provided.
* "invalid recipient address: <err>" - an incorrect Recipient address was provided.

####  404 (Not found)
* "entity not found" - the specified Recipient address or Airdrop ID was not found.

#### 500 (Internal error)
* "internal error" - some internal server error.

### Blockchain load limitation
To smooth blockchain load and ensure stable operation, method `/v1/airdrop/claim` has specific rate limits.
If the blockchain is currently under high load (many messages in the shard queue),
method `/v1/airdrop/claim` is blocked (`{"code":4, "message":"blockchain overload"}` 423 error)
for some Recipients until the load decreases.
This limitation is technically justified, and removing it won't improve the Claim situation for Recipients,
as their Claims will still be delayed.

### Example call Claim function from dApp

<ExampleTabs>

  <ExampleTab label="JavaScript">
```javascript
import { tonConnectUI } from '@tonconnect/ui';

function claimJetton(claimId, userAddress) {
    const claimUrl = `https://mainnet-airdrop.tonapi.io/v1/airdrop/claim/${userAddress}?id=${airdropId}`;
    fetch(claimUrl)
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then(({ claimMessage }) => {
            tonConnectUI.sendTransaction({
                validUntil: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 300, // 5 minutes
                messages: [
                    {
                        address: claimMessage.address,
                        amount: claimMessage.amount,
                        payload: claimMessage.payload,
                        stateInit: claimMessage.state_init,
                    },
                ],
            });
        })
        .catch((error) => console.error('Error:', error));
}

claimJetton('<ID of Airdrop from tonconsole>', '<User address from tonConnectUI>');
```

  </ExampleTab>

</ExampleTabs>

### Test Ð¡laim button

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸš¨">
  It is used for testing purposes and leads to a reference implementation of the application.
  Do not use it for production distribution, as it is not intended for that and does not guarantee reliable operation.
</Callout>

## Distribution completion procedure

Before withdrawing profit and remaining Jettons, you need to properly complete the distribution to prevent Recipients from attempting to Claim after the distribution has ended.

First, you need to click the `Disable claim` button to deactivate the API Claim endpoint through the dApp.
Second, click the `Complete airdrop` button to send special messages that lock the distribution contracts.
After this, you can safely withdraw the remaining Jettons and accumulated TONs from the distribution contracts to the Airdrop admin`s address.

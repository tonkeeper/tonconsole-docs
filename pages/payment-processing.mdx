# Payment Processing

We offer a variety of payment processing solutions for the TON network and can provide one tailored to your specific needs.
Additionally, solutions can be customized to meet specific requirements.

These solutions are capable of handling a large volume of payments and are suitable for integration into CEX-scale products.
Our solutions are already in use by CEXes and other clients.

## What key features can be provided depending on the processing approach

### Asset types
1) TON
2) Jettons

### Deployment and maintenance
1) Self-hosted solutions are available, providing full control over all sensitive information and reducing risks.
2) Access to auxiliary services, such as liteservers, can be provided for reliable and stable operation.

### Level of interaction with blockchain
1) Only blockchain monitoring and indexing of payment-related transactions without storing private keys.
2) Upon request, functionality for message assembly and signing by a trusted party can be added.
3) A solution with a full-fledged payment processor that both monitors and performs transfers.

### By method of payment acceptance
1) Acceptance of payments to one or a few contracts (wallets) with a text comment (memo).
2) Acceptance of payments to individual deposit addresses for each user (no comment required).

### Interfaces for interaction with services
1) REST API
2) Existing interfaces can be modified, or new ones developed, according to the customer's requirements.

### Source code
1) Closed-source solution.
2) Open-source solution with our support.

### Level of trust when interacting with blockchain
The liteapi interface, provided by liteservers, is used for the interaction of offchain services with the TON blockchain.
To ensure trust in the data received through this interface and to exclude the possibility of data falsification by a liteserver, a proof-check mechanism is used.
Our solutions are based on libraries that support proof checks and provide secure and trustless communication with liteservers (including public ones).
This allows you to use not only trusted personal liteservers but also solutions that involve purchasing access to liteservers.

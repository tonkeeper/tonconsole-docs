# Deep Linking into Tonkeeper
Your application might operate outside of Tonkeeper, like a website or a mobile app. Deep links allow you to seamlessly direct users back to a meaningful location within the Tonkeeper app.

## Deep linking with `tonkeeper://`

Use the `tonkeeper://` URI scheme to deep link into a user's Tonkeeper client on the following platforms:

- **Mobile clients**:
  - iPhone
  - Android

### Supported URI Schemes

Tonkeeper supports multiple URI schemes, allowing for flexibility depending on the context in which the link is used. The following schemes are supported:

- **`ton://`**: This scheme is part of the broader TON blockchain standard, enabling interoperability across different TON-based wallets and services.
- **`tonkeeper://`**: A custom URI scheme specifically for deep linking into the Tonkeeper app.
- **`https://app.tonkeeper.com/`**: A web-based scheme that can be used in browsers and other environments that do not support custom URI schemes.

All three schemes are interchangeable and serve similar purposes, directing users to specific actions or pages within Tonkeeper.

### Supported URIs

For each supported action, the structure of the URI is the same across all three schemes. Replace `{PREFIX}` with the desired scheme (`ton://`, `tonkeeper://`, or `https://app.tonkeeper.com/`).

#### **Transfer**

##### **1. Open Transfer Screen**

**Description:** Opens the pre-filled Send screen and prompts the user to enter the missing data.

  - `{ADDRESS}` (required): The recipient's TON address.
  - `amount` (optional): The amount of TON to send, in nanocoins.
  - `text` (optional): A URL-encoded UTF-8 text message to attach to the transfer.

**Examples:**

  ```
  {PREFIX}transfer/{ADDRESS}?amount={AMOUNT}&text={TEXT}
  ```

##### **2. Address with Encrypted Comment**

**Description:** Opens the Send screen with a pre-filled encrypted comment. This can be done using either `https://app.tonkeeper.com/` or `tonkeeper://` schemes.

  tonkeeper://transfer/{ADDRESS}?amount={AMOUNT}&bin={BINARY_DATA}
  ```

  - `{ADDRESS}` (required): The recipient's TON address.
  - `amount` (optional): The amount of TON to send, in nanocoins.
  - `text` (optional): A URL-encoded UTF-8 text message to attach to the transfer.
